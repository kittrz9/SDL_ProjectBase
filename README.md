# SDL Project Base
A really basic SDL thing to just kinda make more stuff off of

Pretty much the same thing as the CSFML project base but in SDL (This time mainly to learn SDL)

---

# Todo:

`Audio stuff`<br>
`Optimize stuff`<br>
`Organize stuff better`<br>
`Add a config file thing (Probably with like XML or something)`<br>
`Multithreading?`<br>
`More types in types.h`<br>
`Maybe start using CMake?`<br>
`Controller support`<br>
