# SDL Project Base
A really basic SDL thing to just kinda make more stuff off of

Pretty much the same thing as the CSFML project base but in SDL (This time mainly to learn SDL)<br>

# Compiling
I think the only thing you really need is SDL2 and other SDL2 libraries like SDL_ttf and SDL_mixer to compile it, which you should be able to get just from whatever package manager you're using on linux. If you're on windows it's probably on the libsdl.org site but idk<br>
It should work by just doing `make` in the command line since it's not a really complex project lmao<br>
`make debug` includes debug stuff for stuff like gdb<br>

# Todo:

`Add music playing`<br>
`Make audio playing not garbage`<br>
`Fix the length stuff in the audio synthesis`<br>
`Optimize stuff`<br>
`Make the makefile not garbage`<br>
`Move stuff like headers into an include directory`<br>
`Add a config file thing (Probably with like XML or something)`<br>
`Multithreading?`<br>
`More types in types.h`<br>
`Maybe start using CMake?`<br>
`Controller support`<br>
`Animation system or something`<br>
`Maybe just move to just regular OpenGL lmao`<br>
