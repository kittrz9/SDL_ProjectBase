# SDL Project Base
A really basic SDL thing to just kinda make more stuff off of

Pretty much the same thing as the CSFML project base but in SDL (This time mainly to learn SDL)<br>

---

# Compiling
I think the only thing you really need is SDL 2 to compile it.<br>
It should work by just doing `make` in the command line since it's not a really complex project lmao<br>
`make debug` includes debug stuff for stuff like gdb<br>

---

# Todo:

`Audio stuff`<br>
`Optimize stuff`<br>
`Make the makefile not garbage`<br>
`Move stuff like headers into an include directory`<br>
`Seperate the game specific stuff like the player stuff from the engine stuff`<br>
`Add a config file thing (Probably with like XML or something)`<br>
`Multithreading?`<br>
`More types in types.h`<br>
`Maybe start using CMake?`<br>
`Controller support`<br>
`Animation system or something`<br>
`Maybe just move to just regular OpenGL lmao`<br>
